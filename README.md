### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”¸ I am a Back-end oriented Full Stack Developer with the ability to make web projects always keeping in mind that they are scalable and modularizable so we can build as a team.

ðŸ”¸The company that chooses me will get a curious developer with great problem solving skills and above all a developer always willing to teach and learn from others.

My work history:
ðŸ”¸ My experience has been mainly in the academic field, for 3 years I worked as a systems engineering student where I learned strong foundations in algorithmics and data structure management.
ðŸ”¸ I am currently attending the henry bootcamp, where I could exercise my technical skills, but above all my social skills as a developer.
